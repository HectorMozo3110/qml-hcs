    Parameters
    ----------

        Must satisfy ``K >= 2`` in downstream usage.
    symmetric : bool, optional

    Generate structured counterfactual futures on top of a base projector.

    Given a current state ``s_t``, first obtains a base set of futures from
    ``Projector.project``. Then, for each user-provided perturbation, it adds a
    single variant (and optionally its symmetric mirror) around the base center.

    Notes
    -----
    The final future set is the concatenation of:
    - the projector's base set ``(K, D)``,
    - one row per perturbation,
    - (optionally) one mirrored row per perturbation.

        Produce a combined future set ``(K', D)`` from base projection and variants.

        Steps
        -----
        1. Call the base projector to obtain ``base_set`` with shape ``(K, D)``.
        2. If perturbations are provided, compute the center as ``mean(base_set, axis=0)``.
        3. For each perturbation ``p``, append ``p(center)`` as a new row.
        4. If ``symmetric`` is enabled, also append the mirrored row
           ``2 * center - p(center)``.

        Parameters
        ----------
        s_t : TensorLike
            Current state vector ``(D,)``.
